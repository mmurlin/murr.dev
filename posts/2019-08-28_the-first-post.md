# The First Post

My name is Matthew Murr. I'm a software developer. I call myself 'wurrm' on
the internet sometimes because I think it's clever. No one else has said so
yet.

Over the next few weeks/years I'm gonna think about things, and sometimes I'll
write down what I think about here. Keep your eyes peeled for posts on the
literal magic of technology, the overwhelming power of undergrad mathematics,
and the warm hug of a good read.

# Farming Commits on GitHub
## Or is it friendliness en masse?
Intening to return to contributing to open source, I took a gander at the
commits of larger projects on GitHub to see what kind of work people were
putting out there. Unsuprisingly, PRs fixing typos were stunningly common.

After some clicks, whirs, the AOL dialup noise and a good night's rest, I had
a thought: gee, some of those are probably automated right? Again, 
unsurprisingly, they were. I won't name any names, point any fingers or link
any accounts, but I thought I'd take you on a brief tour of what I found.

# Why Does This Blog Exist?

It feels like the activity I do most, after pretending I know how to code, is
pretending I know how to design, describe and defer code. Most of the
development I do is as part of a team, and almost all of it will
be read by someone else. This means I have to consider and communicate the
design of my programs [before](http://zeynepaltan.info/IEEE%20SDD-1016-2009.pdf),
[during](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/game/q_math.c#L561)
and [after](https://xkcd.com/1296/) writing them. A travesty, I know.

Now, while I'm not *bad* at communicating, those of you who have read the post
thus far might have come to the conclusion that I could be better if I
practised some more, and you're right. Those of you who haven't read the post
thus far have definitely come to that conclusion. The hope is that writing
consistently and putting more work into finding the right words for whatever
hocus pocus is going on in my brain at any given moment will help.

Improving my writing just for communication is just one reason I think it'd be a
pretty chill idea to write regularly though. For one, writing is really a
representation of abstract thought, so it's a tool to whet my critical thinking
ability on the regular. Now like I say, I program often, but the set of
abstractions you deal with in software is still a subset of all the other
things you think about (although, the more I think about it the less this statement feels
correct). And even for the bits of brain I use to program, writing is
still really useful. It's an opportunity to make sure I have at
least some idea that I actually know the things that I know.

The reason this is a blog rather than say, some pages on a spiral pad from WHSmiths, is because
I think it'll be cool for other people to read and potentially interact with
the stuff I put out. I want to talk with interesting people with interesting things to say.
Then I'll have more content for my blog, and more intersting people will talk
to me. My end game is following this feedback loop to its conclusion.

Most of all though, I think it'll be fun. And if the blog isn't fun, why bother?

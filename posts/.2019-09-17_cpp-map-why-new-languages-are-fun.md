# C++: Accessing an Element in a map
## Or, Layers on Layers on Layers

This post isn't meant to be a put down of C++ (I'm not nearly good enough to
justify doing that), nor is it meant to be any comprehensive guide to using
maps in C++. Part of what makes languages so fun to learn are the small ways
they get you to rethink how to conceptualise or implement a concept. This post
provides an example in a place I didn't expect to find one.

## The Problem

From (exercism.io's 'nucleotide-count' problem)[TODO]
> Given a string of DNA (ie containing only the characters `ACGT`) count the
frequencies of each 'nucleotide' (a character in the string).

Our interface looks like this:

```
class Counter
{
    std::map<char, int> ntc;
public:
    Counter(std::string nt);
    int count(char c);
    std::map<char, int>
}
```

## A (Very) Simple C Hashmap

## The C++ `map` Class
## map::operator[]

## map::find

## map::at

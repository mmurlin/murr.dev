# The First Post

Hey there. My name is Matthew Murr. I'm a software developer. I call myself
'wurrm' on the internet sometimes because I think it sounds pretty boss.
No one else has said so yet.

Over the next few weeks/years I'm gonna think about things, and sometimes I'll
write down what I think about here. Keep your eyes peeled however you find
comfortable for posts on the literal magic of technology, the overwhelming
power of undergrad mathematics, and the warm hug of a good read.

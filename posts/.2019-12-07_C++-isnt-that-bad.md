# C++ Isn't That Bad!

This is a summary of a brief seminar-style event I gave for university students
learning basic C++. A lot of it is targetted specifically at the problems they had
with the course, but I was told it was useful, and if it could help others, I'd
like to share it with you!

Some familiarity with the basic syntax of C++ is assumed.

## Compiler-first thinking
As you read your code, think: how does the compiler interpret this?
## Header files are just code files
## Overloaded functions are just functions
## Operators are just functions
## Key concepts
In general, there are only a handful of concepts in C++ that are 'core' to
understanding the rest of the language. Pretty much everything else is built on
top of them.

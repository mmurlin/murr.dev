<h1>Procrastination Station</h1>
<p>I've been busy these past few months. Very busy. With important, vital and
ideally time-consuming work. However, the months have come and gone,
and neither of my readers are yet to receive a new post.</p>
<p>However, let us assume you do not wish to be like me, that you do not want to be busy with important, vital and
definitely time-consuming work. What if you wanted to procrastinate instead?
This page will list some recommended materials, that hopefully will help you
achieve your goals in style. Healthy, normal people may also find these items
fruitful as part of a balanced lifestyle.</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/meditations/oclc/1097574751">Marcus Aurelius' Meditations</a> is my favourite book to psyche myself out with.
It's not often you're judged for things you're doing right now from 2000 years
in the past. I don't really understand why it gets as much hype as it does, but
it has a lot of resonant and suprisingly practical advice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/visual-display-of-quantitative-information/oclc/957020017">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte</a>
reminds me a lot
of The Elements of Style. It's sharp and insightful, full of unflinching
opinions and rules, and they both ooze expertise. But The Visual Display is
more of a thorough and polished piece, with the rigorous and careful hand that
career mathematicians and researchers often give off.
It's a concert of everything Tufte loves about the field, and the whole book
flows nicely at every level. This book is also <em>gorgeous</em>. There's no better
way to convince the reader that the field is a clash of the mathematically and
visually beautiful than to perform at such a high level on both fronts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/compilers-principles-techniques-and-tools/oclc/1136160796">Alfred Aho, Ravi Sethi, Jeffrey Ullman - Compilers: Principles, Techniques and
Tools</a>,
aka The Dragon Book is a mountain. Where other books kindly guide you up the tourist path, this one shows
you where the mountain is and gives you the tools. It's not nearly as bad as people
will tell you, wherever and whenever it is brought up (i.e., whenever
compiler design resources are discussed), but this book is a monolith in
compiler design for a reason. I'm really enjoying it.</p>
<h2>Blogs</h2>
<p>I <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3">stumbled</a> across a pretty neat professor guy called <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/">Scott
Aaronson</a> who talks about quantum
computers at a level I can understand but with real insight into the kinds of
questions real quantum computing researchers are asking. His book is also
pretty sweet.</p>
<p><a href="http://n-gate.com">n-gate</a> is not a blog. But as digests go, it's pretty
great. The author's bottomless wit helps the opinionated cynicism go down, and
if nothing else this site serves to remind you to think about what you read
critically, rather than letting someone else do the thinking for you.</p>
<p>Jeroen Domburg, of <a href="https://spritesmods.com/">SpritesMods</a> is a legendary hardware and software
hacker. His thing is reverse engineering everything for lots of fun and
profit. <a href="https://spritesmods.com/?art=magicbrush">Here he reverses inkjet cartridges</a>.
<a href="https://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack">Here he reverses a hard drive</a>.
<a href="https://spritesmods.com/?art=tamasingularity">Here he creates xkcd's Tamagotchi Singularity</a>.
And those are just my favourites. They've been a pleasure to re-read.</p>
<p>Tim Urban makes internet noise using text on <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/">Wait But Why</a>.
<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html">This post</a> is
scarily, eye-openingly accurate description of my experience from ages 15 to
$curr_age, and arguably led to the existence of this post.
A lot of the enjoyability of his essays is that these are things
that everyone thinks about all of the time (assuming I am a representative
sample), but with vividly illustrated spins and angles that serve for
brilliant mental models and thought experiments.</p>
<h2>Podcasts</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s7d6/episodes/downloads">The Long View</a>
is one of the few takes on current events that I can tolerate. The structure of
the show is simply to compare a historical event with a current event. The host tends
to take a stance of highlighting similarities rather than contrasting, but the show gives a
genuinely useful lens to view current events, rather than a shallow
presentation of soundbites and trite that is quickly forgotten.</p>
<p>Jason Scott (of textfiles.com and Internet Archive fame) has a podcast
called <a href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/podcast">Jason Scott Talks His Way Out Of It</a>.
I have listened to the teleconferencing episode perhaps 5 times. He has
wonderful charm, a bag full of anecdotes and a wealth of knowledge, as any good
historian should.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lexfridman.com/ai/">AI podcast with Lex Fridman</a>, whilst always touching on AI, is not really
about AI. It's about really good questions paired with incredible guests, giving
insight into their lives and their deep opinions on the fields
that they interact with. My favourite is probably <a href="https://lexfridman.com/bjarne-stroustrup/">this interview with Bjarne
Stroustrup</a>. Stroustrup has this wonderful clarity and thoughtfulness to
everything he says, and this interview gives a really great round tour of his
thoughts on languages from several levels of analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://notrelated.xyz/">Not Related!</a> Is a fairly recent podcast from
PeerTuber Luke Smith on things he read about. The episodes serve as pretty
slick introductions and complements to fields and theses that at least several
people find interesting. The episode on rationality was a especially
eye-opening one: while I once assumed <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a>
was a hive of wizards when I first came across it, Luke has highlighted a lot
of implicit assumptions that are lodged in some of the thinking there.
(Luke also wrote a cool <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/files/papers/reason.pdf">paper</a>
on the subject, which I thoroughly enjoyed.)</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I haven't spent much time searching out for new music recently, but these are
some fun sounds I've found around the past couple of months.</p>
<p>Christopher Larkin is the man behind the OST of Hollow Knight. Recently he
released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRs58D34OLY">some samples from the Silksong sequel</a>,
featuring crisp instrumentation, which I think is very pretty on the ears and
very evocative, in a way that only video game music tends to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/Sufjan-Stevens-Illinoise/master/14863">Sufjan Stevens' Illinoise</a>
is an oddity I found while trundling through my library. Despite a
pretty huge tracklisting (and track-titling) there aren't many songs here that
I dislike. In terms of songwriting specifically, it's masterful and incredibly
varied.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.discogs.com/Desert-Sessions-Desert-Sessions-Vol-11-12/master/1625387">Desert Sessions 11 &amp; 12</a>
is a bit all over the place, but that just adds to the bonkers sand party
rollercoaster this record is and was the result of. Just listen to it.</p>
<h2>YouTube</h2>
<p>The more I use YouTube, the more I dislike it a little more, and the more my
caveman brain tries to smother my screaming consciousness. The way YouTube
manipulates the presentation of the underlying data, which can only ever be
accessed through their warped rankings and recommendations, becomes more and
more irritating as time and recommended videos go by. Here are some things I
have watched on it lately.</p>
<p>I usually dislike video essay channels, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9WQRw8jgJhag-vkDNTDMRg">Coffee
Break</a> gives informed
introductory summaries on several topics that actually interest me.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fq8HOguXGFI">This video</a> on some of the
problems with modern academia is quite illuminating.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BedBananas/">BedBananas</a> - I don't really like
video essay channels, but I really do dislike
most video game channels. Bed here is different. His videos are cinematic
masterpieces disguised as comedic masterpieces, or vice versa depending on your
perspective. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoaDebK9-9I">Observe</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w">You Suck at Cooking</a>
is reasonably good at cooking, but an incredible story teller, musician, and
funny disembodied pair of hands. The egg narrative is legendary.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT">MIT OpenCourseWare</a> after
they uploaded the legendary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY">How To Speak lecture</a>
from the late Patrick Winston. While most everything available on the channel
is also on <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu">ocw.mit.edu</a>, you bump into a lot of cool
stuff just scrolling through the channel. I especially recommend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63VIBQVWguXxZZi0566y7Wf">Course 6.172, Performance Engineering of Software
Systems</a>,
both in general but also specifically for the talks on language implementation.</p>
